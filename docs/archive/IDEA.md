# IDEA: Amble — Your gentle companion for daily wellness

## Description

Amble is a gentle AI companion that helps elderly individuals living alone maintain daily wellness routines through small, adaptive nudges. It learns engagement patterns, notices early signs of withdrawal, and responds with supportive actions rather than rigid reminders. When needed, Amble keeps family members thoughtfully informed while preserving independence and dignity.

## Project Description

Amble helps elderly individuals (50+) maintain healthy routines and stay connected with family through an intelligent AI companion. For seniors, it offers voice-first interactions for tracking expenses, discovering local activities, managing health reminders, and connecting with loved ones, with no complex technology required. For family members living far away, Amble provides a peace-of-mind dashboard with wellness insights and smart alerts.

Unlike simple reminder apps, Amble’s AI agents learn and adapt using conversational English, proactively discovering relevant activities, detecting concerning patterns, and coordinating family communication. Built for a global context where elderly parents increasingly live independently while children work in different cities, Amble transforms isolation into connection and worry into assurance.

## Problem

Many elderly individuals living alone struggle to maintain consistent daily routines such as physical activity, social interaction, and basic self-care. When routines break down, this often leads to loneliness, declining wellbeing, and disengagement, especially after the motivation of New Year’s resolutions fades.

Most existing solutions rely on static reminders or manual family check-ins. These approaches do not adapt to changing behavior, fail to detect gradual disengagement, and place emotional and logistical burden on caregivers.

## Opportunity

Amble introduces an agentic AI companion designed specifically for elderly users that goes beyond reminders. The system continuously observes routine signals, detects early signs of disengagement, and autonomously takes supportive action by adjusting nudges based on what works, encouraging gentle activities and social interaction, and escalating to trusted family members only when meaningful changes occur.

Amble is intentionally non-medical and non-intrusive, focusing on daily wellness, consistency, and human connection while giving families peace of mind through optional visibility and summaries.

## Why It Matters

Daily routines are the foundation of long-term wellbeing. By helping elderly users stay engaged, connected, and supported without overwhelming them or their families, Amble turns good intentions into sustainable habits.

## Progress

**Current Phase:** Concept development and technical architecture

**Completed:**
- Identified core problems including loneliness, budget management, health tracking, and family connection
- Designed a dual-interface system with a simple voice-first experience for elderly users and a dashboard for families
- Mapped AI agent capabilities across five key areas
- Selected a free-tier tech stack for rapid prototyping (examples used in early exploration)

**Next Steps:**
- Build voice interaction MVP
- Implement expense tracking agent
- Test with elderly users and iterate on prompts and behavior
- Develop family dashboard prototype
